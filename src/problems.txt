Problems:
- when triggering via software the camera might get stuck in trying to autofocus
  -> after that it's kind of broken and can't be controlled anymore. Fixable?
- after triggering via the trigger box the camera can't be controlled via
  software anymore (some things like event handling and picture downloading
  still work but not software triggering or changing to preview mode)
  -> for now: only trigger via software and not via trigger box
