libgphoto2 internals:

- most of the actual work is performed by the actual camera driver, which is ptp for canon eos cams
- camlibs/ptp2/
- camlibs/ptp2/config.c
	- update capture target
	- prepare/unprepare capture
	- prepared when the camera is started, unprepared on exit
- camlibs/ptp2/library.c
	- actual gp work
	- camera_capture -> camera_canon_eos_capture
	- camera_trigger_capture -> ptp_canon_eos_capture -> set remoterelease
	- all captures prepare capture first if it's not enabled or else update the target to -1
	- "Get the initial bulk set of event data, otherwise capture might return busy."
	- capture is essentially the same as trigger capture plus waiting loop for getting the pic
	- watch out for CPR, CR macros that check result and return on error
		- cr check result, cpr check ptp result
- camera style detected from supported ptp operations
	- only nikon dslr, canon powershot, canon eos
	- ViewFinderOn / EOS_GetViewFinderData
	- InitiateReleaseControl / EOS_RemoteRelease
- ptp_canon_eos_keepdeviceon() randomly sprinkled around

- for some reason, exiting the camera locks its physical button ui up
	- ... unless the shutter button is pressed ...
	- ... but then the capture target stays in the memory setting instead of camera
	- ui opens up again when a new connection is established or the camera is booted or usb cable removed

- many unknown events come from "unknown" ptp property changes that are actually known
	- menus in camlibs/ptp2/config.c and big lists in ptp.h
	- "/* From EOS 400D trace. */" important, PTP_DPC_CANON_EOS_* have the same specifiers
	- d102 shutter speed
	- d101 aperture
	- d11b iso
	- d17c current time in unix timestamp
	- would be nice to be able to map the ptp id to gphoto widget id
		- then refresh just it instead of getting full config tree again
		- (maybe this is optimized in camera_get_config, dunno, it's difficult to read)


- lib full of potential dangers with buffer overflows
	- config values, 1024B buffers
	- filenames, paths, folders with fixed size buffers, plain strcpy
